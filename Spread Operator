Spread Operator
The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

Example 
const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];

The spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring.

Example
Assign the first and second items from numbers to variables and put the rest in an array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const [one, two, ...rest] = numbers;

We can use the spread operator with objects too:

Example
Combine these two objects:

const myVehicle = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  color: 'red'
}

const updateMyVehicle = {
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'yellow'
}

const myUpdatedVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle}


Modules
JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.

This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.

ES Modules rely on the import and export statements.

Export
You can export a function or variable from any file.

Let us create a file named person.js, and fill it with the things we want to export.

There are two types of exports: Named and Default.

Named Exports
You can create named exports two ways. In-line individually, or all at once at the bottom.

Example 
In-line individually:

person.js

export const name = "Jesse"
export const age = 40

All at once at the bottom:
person.js

const name = "Jesse"
const age = 40

export { name, age }

Default Exports
Let us create another file, named message.js, and use it for demonstrating default export.

You can only have one default export in a file.

Example
message.js

const message = () => {
  const name = "Jesse";
  const age = 40;
  return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';
};

export default message;
Import
You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are named exports or default exports.

Named exports must be destructured using curly braces. Default exports do not.

Example
Import named exports from the file person.js:

import { name, age } from "./person.js";
