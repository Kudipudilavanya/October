-----React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is used to build single-page applications.

React allows us to create reusable UI components.

for example :import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<Hello />);

-----How does React Work?
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

React only changes what needs to be changed!

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.

You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this tutorial.


-----What is ES6?
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.

ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.

-----React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like:

Classes
Arrow Functions
Variables (let, const, var)
Array Methods like .map()
Destructuring
Modules
Ternary Operator
Spread Operator
