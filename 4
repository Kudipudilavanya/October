Array Methods
There are many JavaScript array methods.

One of the most useful in React is the .map() array method.

The .map() method allows you to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result.

In React, map() can be used to generate lists.

Generate a list of items from an array:

const myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

const myList = myArray.map((item) => <p>{item}</p>)

Destructuring
To illustrate destructuring, we'll make a sandwich. Do you take everything out of the refrigerator to make your sandwich? No, you only take out the items you would like to use on your sandwich.

Destructuring is exactly the same. We may have an array or object that we are working with, but we only need some of the items contained in these.

Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.


When destructuring arrays, the order that variables are declared is important.

If we only want the car and suv we can simply leave out the truck but keep the comma:

const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car,, suv] = vehicles;


Here is the new way of assigning array items to a variable:

Example
With destructuring:

const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car, truck, suv] = vehicles;

Destructuring Objects
Here is the old way of using an object inside a function:

Example
Before:

const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'red'
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne);

// old way
function myVehicle(vehicle) {
  const message = 'My ' + vehicle.type + ' is a ' + vehicle.color + ' ' + vehicle.brand + ' ' + vehicle.model + '.';
}
Here is the new way of using an object inside a function:

Example
With destructuring:

const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'red'
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne);

function myVehicle({type, color, brand, model}) {
  const message = 'My ' + type + ' is a ' + color + ' ' + brand + ' ' + model + '.';
}
