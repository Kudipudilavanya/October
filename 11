React Class Components
Before React 16.8, Class components were the only way to track state and lifecycle on a React component. Function components were considered "state-less".

With the addition of Hooks, Function components are now almost equivalent to Class components. The differences are so minor that you will probably never need to use a Class component in React.

Even though Function components are preferred, there are no current plans on removing Class components from React.

This section will give you an overview of how to use Class components in React.

Feel free to skip this section, and use Function Components instead.

React Components
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this chapter you will learn about Class components.

Create a Class Component
When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.

The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

ExampleGet your own React.js Server
Create a Class component called Car

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

Now your React application has a component called Car, which returns a <h2> element.

To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as normal HTML: <Car />

Example
Display the Car component in the "root" element:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);
